To start this tutorial, I had to configure the Roles on osTicket. I did that by going to the Admin Panel, clicking on the Agents tab, and then on the Roles tab. Once inside the Roles section, I clicked the "Add New Role" tab and created the "Supreme Admin Role" while assigning it permissions. The permissions I gave to the new role will allow specific access to that role on osTicket.

<p>
In the next step, I configured the Departments by going to the Agents section and clicking the Departments tab. I created a "New Department" inside the Departments section and named it "System Administrators."
</p>

<p>
The next step in the process is configuring the teams in this example. I did that by ensuring I was still in the Admin Panel and going into the Agents section. Once inside the Agents section, I clicked on the team's tab, created two new teams, and named them "Level I Support" and "Level II Support." The teams need to be made because they allow agents from different departments to be pulled and organized to handle specific issues or help a user via Help Topic or Ticket Finder.

<p>
As I continued, I edited the settings to allow anyone to create new tickets. To allow this to happen, I went inside the settings and had to click on users, and inside the user's settings, I was able to edit and enable anyone to create new tickets.

<p>
Moving forward, I had to edit the Agents(Workers) settings. The settings I changed will give agents access to the help desk to respond to and resolve the tickets assigned to them. To do this, I went to the agent's section and clicked "Add New Agent." Here I created two sample agents named Jane Doe and John Doe. I also edited their Access, Permissions, and the Team they would be assigned to.

</p>
<p>
This step involved me creating new sample Users(Customers). First, I had to leave the Admin Panel and switch to the Agent Panel on osTicket. When I switched over, I clicked on the Users tab and clicked on "Add User." Here I created two new sample users who would be the customers in this scenario and named them Kelly Kelly and Ken Ken to keep it simple.

<p>
Moving ahead in this tutorial, I created and configured the company SLAs. SLAs will vary from company to company and are designed to provide a timeframe of when the help desk admin expects the tickets to be resolved/closed. I configured the SLAs by returning the Admin Panel and clicking on the manage section. Once this section loaded, I clicked on the SLA tab and selected "New SLA." Here I created three new SLA plans based on the severity of the problem. The SLA's I created were SEV-A(1 hour, 24/7), SEV-B(4 hours, 24/7), and lastly, SEV-C(8 hours, Business Hours).

In the final step of this tutorial, I created four new Help Topics that would help streamline the end user's experience to ensure topics are correctly assigned and receive a fast response to each ticket made. The Help Topics also determine what Department the ticket is sent to, which agent will have access to the ticket, and what SLA is assigned to that ticket. To create these Help Topics, I had to return to the "Manage" tab inside the Admin Panel and click on Help Topics. Once here, I was able to create the four new Help Topics, which I named "Business Critical Outage," "Personal Computer Issues," "Equipment Request," and the final one was "Password Reset." In reference to my last picture, you can see the Help Topics I created along with the default Help Topics that had already been made when downloading osTicket.
